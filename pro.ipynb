    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Insights from Correlation Analysis\n",
    "         \n",
    "* Correlation between the foreign gross and domestic gross had a strong positive. This implies that an increase in domestic gross could also be reflected with an increase in foreign gross.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Domestic gross and the year have a weak correlation. Equally foreign gross and the year have a weak relationship. For predictive modelling, the positive correlation between the domestic gross and foreign gross will be an important relationship to consider. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Production budget has a positive correlation with both domestic gross and worldwide gross, with the later being stronger at 0.7392. This relationship implies that production budgets of movies have a relatively strong and positive relationship with both domestic and gross earning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Runtime has a weak relationship with production budget, domestic and worldwide gross. The correlation between runtime and production budget was 0.0040. Equally, the correlation between runtime with both domestic and worldwide gross was negative at -0.000906 and -0.003864, depicting a very weak relationship hence the revenue values as a function of runtime cannot be modeled using a linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Similarly, runtime as a function of movie production budget cannot be accurately modeled using a linear model because the p-value of 4.13e-09 obtained is significantly smaller than the usual significance level of 0.05.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* There is a positive linear relationship between domestic gross and foreign gross  as well as domestic gross and worldwide gross. Hence a linear model is suitable to model domestic gross, foreign gross and worldwide gross revenues for the movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The higher production budgets generally correlate with higher total revenue, most movies fall within a lower budget and revenue range. \n",
    "\n",
    "*  There is a moderate positive correlation between production budget and profitability, but a very weak negative correlation between production budget and ROI.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Insights on Genre Revenue Trends in Domestic and Worldwide Markets\n",
    "\n",
    "* Musical and Performing Arts consistently outperforms other genres in both domestic and worldwide gross revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Horror and Science Fiction and Fantasy also show strong performance in both domestic and worldwide markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Classics and Documentary have a higher average domestic gross compared to their worldwide performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Certain genres, such as Drama (orange) and Science Fiction and Fantasy (green), are more likely to achieve higher total revenue and profit, as these points appear more frequently among the higher values\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Insights from Production Budget and Genre Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "*  Genres such as Action and Adventure and Science Fiction and Fantasy are associated with both high production budgets\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*  In contrast, genres like Documentary and Special Interest tend to have smaller budgets and lower domestic revenue\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*  Most movies have relatively low production budgets and domestic grosses, with only a few movies achieving very high values in either category.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Insights on Movie Ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "* High-rated movies(with ratings >=8) tend to be slightly shorter on average, but they're actually more likely to be over 2 hours long with a percentage of 9.9% compared to 7.9% for low rated movies (with ratings < 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The standard deviation of High rated movies of 39.04 is significant. The minimum movie runtime was 4 minutes long with the maximum at 1440. The 1440 minutes suggests existence of outliers in the dataset since the average average runtime for high rated movies was 88.62 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The standard deviation of low rated movies of 19.04 is significant, implying big variations in the run time. The minimum movie runtime was 4 minutes long with the maximum at 480. The 480 minutes suggests existence of outliers in the dataset. The average runtime for low rated movies was 92.71 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  We are recommending to the company to prioritize releasing more movies during the months of June, July and December. December is the most profitable month and therefore aiming at this timeframe could maximize on box office revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  We recommend to the company to utilize lower budget or experimental films in months like January and September which have lower revenue to maintain a consistent presence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  We also recommend to the company to increase marketing efforts leading up to and during January and September to maximize opening-weekend success and overall revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Release High-Potential Films in November-December as it shows strong performance in revenue. We would recommend to the company to release family-oriented films and holiday-themed movies during this timeframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  We recommend the company diversify its film portfolio by including more investments in lower-budget projects to enhance overall profitability and mitigate financial risk. Allocating a portion of funds to smaller, strategically selected productions that offer high returns relative to their cost will support this goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  We recommend the company implement stricter budget controls and optimize resource allocation to focus spending on elements that enhance the film's appeal without unnecessarily inflating costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  We recommend the company develop tailored marketing campaigns for lower-budget films, utilizing cost-effective promotional strategies to enhance revenue potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  We recommend to the company to consider producing shorter films for wider audience appeal while also investing in select, high-quality longer films that can captivate audiences and drive engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9.  We recommend allocation of more resources to produce a mix of shorter, high-rating-friendly films and select longer, high-quality projects that will meet the expectations of more targeted audiences.\n"
