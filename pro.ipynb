    "### 1. Project Overview\n",
    "This project aims to develop a predictive model to forecast hotel reservation cancellations. By analyzing historical booking data, the model will identify key factors influencing cancellations, enabling hotels to take proactive actions like overbooking, adjusting policies, or offering incentives. The goal is to reduce revenue loss, optimize resource allocation, and improve customer satisfaction by minimizing cancellations and no-shows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Business Problem\n",
    "Hotels face challenges in managing bookings effectively, as they cannot predict which reservations will be honored. This uncertainty impacts resource allocation, planning, and overall profitability. Predicting cancellations would help hotels optimize booking strategies, reduce losses, and improve customer satisfaction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Business Objectives\n",
    "The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model to accurately forecast hotel reservation cancellations so as to enable hotels to:\n",
    "* Optimize booking strategies and resource allocation based on cancellation predictions. \n",
    "* Minimize revenue loss by proactively managing overbooking and cancellation policies.\n",
    "* Improve customer satisfaction by offering targeted incentives to reduce cancellations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Target Audience\n",
    "The Traget audience for this project are:\n",
    "* Hotel Managers\n",
    "* Revenue Managers\n",
    "* Hotel Owners/Executives\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "### 5. Data\n",
    "The Hotel Reservations dataset used in this project was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/hotel-reservations-classification-dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Data Understanding\n",
    "The data used for this project:\n",
    "* Has 36275 rows and 19 columns\n",
    "* Has No missing Values\n",
    "* Has 5 columns with Categorical data types, 13 columns with Integer data type and one column with float data type\n",
    "* Has no Multicollinearity\n",
    "* Has columns with Outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Cleaning of the data \n",
    "The data has no missing values and therefore require no cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Data Pre_processing\n",
    "The following processes were carried out to the training and test features before building the models:\n",
    "* Identified the dependent and independent variables to use for Modelling\n",
    "* Split the resulting dataframe into train and test splits\n",
    "* Converted categorical variables to Numerical Variables using One Hot Encoding\n",
    "* Scaled some numerical columns using Standard Scaler\n",
    "* Log Transformed the columns that had the greatest skewness\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Modelling\n",
    "In this project, 4 Models were created:\n",
    "1. Logistic Regression Model-Baseline\n",
    "2. Decision Tree Model-Tuned\n",
    "3. Random Forest Model-Untuned\n",
    "4. Random Forest Model- Tuned\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Evaluation\n",
    "The Models were evaluated on two parameters, accuracy score and ROC-AUC score. Below are the outcomes of the evaluation for each Model\n",
    "* Logistic Regression Model(Baseline) - Accuracy Score of 79% and AUC of 0.86\n",
    "* Decision Tree Model(Tuned) - Accuracy score of 84% and AUC of 0.89\n",
    "* Random Forest Model (Untuned) - Accuracy Score of 85% and AUC of 0.91\n",
    "* Random Forest Model(Tuned) - Accuracy Score of 86% and  AUC of 0.92\n",
    "\n",
    "### ROC-AUC Visualizations \n",
    "After building our models, ROC Curve for each Model was plotted. The ROC Curve shows the AUC(The Area Under the Curve). Below are the ROC visualizations for each Model and the combine ROC curves for all the models for better comparison\n",
